# Using React to Build a table of Film openings and local showtimes

## Monday 9 January

Using sample code and having read the article at https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html I have set up a set of files using React to deliver a table of this week's film openings and local showtimes, based on the table at IMDB: http://www.imdb.com/

Using Babel to turn .jsx into .js. and Webpack to bundle source files.
